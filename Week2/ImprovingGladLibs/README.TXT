PROJECT TITLE: ImprovingGladLibs
AUTHORS: https://github.com/danielvillam
DESCRIPTION: Codons are searched in DNA chains, how many unique codons there are, the most frequent codon, depending on an initial position that can be 0, 1 or 2.

The words in a file are searched, the maximum number of repetitions in a word, the words that are repeated an n number of times.

The implementation of GladLib with HashMap is also done to make the code more extensible, to create random histories with different types of labels
